Repo for Data Analytics Module #22 Big Data Challenge

# What the project does: 
Home Sales Challenges enables the use of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then Spark is used to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

# How users can get started with the project: 
Download, run analysis and evaluate results for self. Code allows for creation of big data queries and temporary views using SparkSQL. 

# Resources used for building SQL project include:
Multiple sources such as: I referenced official Bootcamp course material and documentation; instructor teaching (classes & shared resources), aid from fellow students, Google Search, StackOverflow, W3C Schools, content as well as support and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
